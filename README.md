- 👋 Hi, I’m @dnltv
- 👀 In my free time, I prefer active recreation: cycling in summer 🚴🏼, skiing in winter ⛷. If there is an opportunity to arrange a small trip - without thinking twice, I will start! 🗺
- 🌱💻 I’m currently working on Backend Web-development (Python, Django 🤠) and trying to learn as much as possible 🧠
- 📫 How to reach me - daniltreskow@gmail.com, t.me/dnltv 📱
